        St, Blaise Community Academy Inc., formerly known as COMMUNITY HIGH
        SCHOOL , one of the leading schools in town, was founded in 1953. With
        only 6 faculty members and one building it was established to provide
        the youth with a secondary education that will serve and benefit them
        because it was so close to home. Under the long and much felt-needed
        for establishing a high school in Poblacion, Mr. Vicente A. Atienza,
        Director of San Luis Academy in Calumpang San Luis, Batangas, broached
        the idea to several prominent people of San Luis early 1953.
